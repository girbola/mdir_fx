# MDir_FX
MDir_FX helps you organize your pictures and videos to an external hard drive.
The project has been written with JDK 13 and JavaFX 13
This project is my "learning environment" for JavaFX, CSS and other technologies.

** Features **
* Date and time editor for medias that does not have dates and times information
* Avoid duplicates to save space
* Batch copy
* Very poor documentation (improvement is coming soon!)
